## Tutor Comment

I love your use of music! It was a huge surprise. The option to mute the music and lower the volume would have been nice, since it does consume the playthrough.

You have a nice homepage with an intuitive design, and an interesting use of toolbars. I like how you have a "Regret"/undo option, and that there's an "About" page. I think your "Game Help" link is broken however.

Your OO-programming for your GUI design is great. Modularising the GUI like this is important. It would have been good to see more classes to assist WarringStatesGame.java as well. This is something to consider for future. Good use of helper functions too.

Good tests, however more complex test classes and more edge case testing could have been conducted, such as testing for edge cases in ReCode.java and DeCode.java.

Things to note:
-> While playing with bots, when reaching the final move, the program stalls and doesn't display the winners.
-> A lot of your code in WarringStatesGame, particularly in methods such as getFlags, could be condensed by using switch statements rather than if statements.

Overall, fantastic work on your assignment. I look forward to seeing your progress at ANU in the coming years.
