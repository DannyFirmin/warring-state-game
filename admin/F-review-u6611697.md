Review Comments:

best features of code: well documented with comments,use of previously declared methods and follows java code conventions.

though the program achieves to pass most of conditions,the method used is not efficient and the approach to the problem is wrong
as it fails to consider all the possible occurrences.

Scope for improvement:
using the 2-d board array from the class declared before for checking the locations is a good approach

create a new method to check the next location in sequence with it previous location.
