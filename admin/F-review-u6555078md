Review Comments:
Overview:My teammate call the method isMoveLegal() form task 5, as the base of task 6,
which makes the code simple and clear.Then in each step, it only need to change the setup
by repalcing the card in the location with 'Zhangyi',and deleting the card 'Zhangyi'
in the previous location,and repeat the process step by step till moveSequence is used up.
If one step in the process is illegal, the moveSequence is illegal.Overall, it's very clear.


Inperfect:
There still one test failed as below.
java.lang.AssertionError: Move sequence I6OCAFRMGYSUW8QE2Z13L945BDPJHK should be valid, but was rejected
I cannot find where the problem is.
